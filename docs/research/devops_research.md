# DevOps Research — September 22, 2025

## Snapshot
- DevOps teams are standardizing on AI-enhanced automation, platform engineering, and security-by-default practices to balance velocity with governance. citeturn0search1turn0search2turn0search0
- Organizations are unifying software and ML delivery pipelines to eliminate silos and extend DevSecOps controls to model lifecycle management. citeturn0news12
- SMEs face adoption gaps: only 12% run security scans per commit despite 68% reporting DevSecOps programs, revealing a priority-action mismatch. citeturn0academia13

## Key Trends for 2025

### AI-Driven Automation and AIOps
- CI/CD pipelines increasingly use machine learning to predict failures, auto-remediate incidents, and optimize build/deploy timings, lowering downtime and cognitive load. citeturn0search11turn0search5turn0search7
- Autonomous operations extend beyond scripted runbooks by detecting anomalies and enacting fixes without manual intervention, underpinning self-healing infrastructure aspirations. citeturn0search3turn0search2

### Platform Engineering and Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)
- 55% of surveyed enterprises already run platform engineering programs, with 90% planning broader rollout, validating IDPs as the governance layer for self-service delivery. citeturn0search0
- IDPs reduce onboarding time, shrink ticket queues, and centralize compliance controls, enabling scalable DevOps operating models. citeturn0search7turn0search5

### DevSecOps and Security as Code
- Shift-left security is now baseline: automated vulnerability scans, policy-as-code, and zero-trust enforcement ship with every pipeline stage. citeturn0search9turn0search1turn0search6
- Research highlights persistent pain points—complex tooling, cultural resistance, and limited automation budgets—especially in SMEs, driving demand for AI-assisted security. citeturn0academia13turn0academia14

### GitOps, IaC, and Configuration Governance
- Declarative infrastructure with Git as the source of truth improves auditability, rollback, and multicloud management, becoming a default expectation for 2025 programs. citeturn0search1turn0search7turn0search10
- GitOps adoption tightly couples with compliance-as-code to ensure traceable approvals and consistent environments across regulated workflows. citeturn0search4turn0search9

### Observability and Unified SRE Practices
- AI-assisted observability platforms provide predictive insights and anomaly detection, reducing mean-time-to-detect and alert fatigue. citeturn0search1turn0search7turn0search5
- DevOps and MLOps convergence enforces end-to-end traceability across data, model, and application layers, improving reliability of AI-centric products. citeturn0news12

### Sustainability, FinOps, and Edge Readiness
- Teams increasingly track carbon and cost metrics within pipelines, optimizing for energy-efficient builds and cloud spend, especially in DevOps-as-a-service offerings. citeturn0search1turn0search8
- Edge and serverless deployments demand lightweight automation patterns; 2025 roadmaps emphasize Kubernetes at the edge and serverless-first workflows. citeturn0search6turn0search10turn0search8

## Challenges and Gaps
- Cultural resistance and skills shortages slow DevSecOps and AI adoption; 41% of SMEs cite technical complexity as a blocker, underscoring the need for enablement playbooks. citeturn0academia13
- Toolchain sprawl across CI/CD, security, observability, and ML delivery creates integration overhead; unified platforms and reference architectures are emerging as remediation strategies. citeturn0news12turn0search7turn0search0
- Compliance automation lags for container and supply chain security, with limited coverage in SMEs and mid-market operators. citeturn0academia13turn0academia14

## Implementation Practices
- Establish platform teams responsible for golden paths, infrastructure modules, and developer experience metrics; publish service catalogs with policy gates. citeturn0search0turn0search7
- Embed AI-driven observability and security tooling early, ensuring feedback loops feed backlog prioritization and incident postmortems. citeturn0search1turn0search11
- Treat governance artifacts (security policies, compliance baselines, SLOs) as code versions in Git, with automated validation in pipelines. citeturn0search4turn0search9
- Align DevOps, MLOps, and FinOps stakeholders through shared scorecards tracking deployment frequency, lead time, incident metrics, and carbon/cost budgets. citeturn0news12turn0search1turn0search8

## Metrics to Watch
- Deployment Frequency & Lead Time: Target statistical process control, not raw speed, to balance risk. citeturn0search7turn0search3
- MTTR/MTTD: Use AI-enhanced signals to drive continuous incident reduction goals. citeturn0search1turn0search11
- Security Coverage: Track commit-level scan percentages and policy-as-code pass rates to ensure DevSecOps maturity. citeturn0academia13turn0search9
- Platform Adoption: Measure time-to-first-deployment and platform NPS to validate IDP value delivery. citeturn0search0turn0search7

## Emerging Opportunities
- Codifying sustainability KPIs into CI/CD (energy dashboards, carbon-aware scheduling) differentiates enterprise DevOps offerings. citeturn0search1turn0search8
- Expanding ChatOps with LLM copilots for runbook automation and incident triage accelerates remediation cycles. citeturn0search2turn0search11
- Extending zero-trust and supply chain attestations to machine learning artifacts helps secure AI-driven products. citeturn0news12turn0academia14
