  "knowledge": {

Establish a strong **visual hierarchy** using deliberate typography, color, and scale to guide user focus. Structure layouts with core principles like **proximity** (grouping related elements) and ample **white space** to reduce cognitive load. Implement a state-driven SwiftUI architecture where all interactive elements provide immediate **feedback** to confirm user actions. Ensure full **accessibility** compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA, Dynamic Type, VoiceOver).",
    "engineering": "Architect applications into modular packages using Swift Package Manager, applying design philosophies like **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** and **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** to enhance maintainability. Enforce complete Swift 6 concurrency by enabling strict settings (`-strict-concurrency=complete`), ensuring `Sendable` conformance for all data models, and leveraging structured concurrency with `async/await`. Utilize modern Swift features like typed `throws` for explicit error handling and macros to reduce boilerplate.",
    "operations": "Ensure build environment reproducibility by defining all build settings, compiler flags, and environment variables in `.xcconfig` files to eliminate discrepancies between local and CI runs. Implement a comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, snapshot tests, and async integration tests. Manage dependencies strictly via Swift Package Manager, pinning versions for stability and tracking the 'Ready for Swift 6' dashboard to prevent regressions."
